# This repository is a crucial component of the "_ALGORITHM FOR REPRESENTING THE NUMERICAL RANGE OF THE MATRIX IN THE COMPLEX PLANE USING THE PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE_" article.

**Abstract.** In this article, the well-known concept of matrix numerical range from the Functional
Analysis course and its main properties in the form of theorems are described. The problem of representing
the numerical range of the matrix in the complex plane is studied and enriched with the help of examples. In
this case, a function named "draw_numerical_range" prepared using NumPy and Seaborn from certain
libraries of the Python programming language is recommended.

**Key words:** Python programming language, matrix, numeric range, source code, algorithm, library
NumPy, platform GitHub.
